# web-programming-mid-term-project
For my mid term in web programming I was tasked with developing a computer science club site with a team that was responsive using bootstrap.
# What I learned
* Responsive design
* Bootstrap (Obviously not the whole thing for the scope of the project)
* Handling team members strengths and weaknesses
